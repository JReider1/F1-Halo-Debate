        <p>The halo is easily the worst thing to be introduced into formula one. It is supposed to be a safety feature but in reality it is less safe than before.
        The halo sits right in the middle of the driver's viewâ€¦ which is ridiculous why I should have to explain why that's not safe. The halo has now created a blind 
        spot for drivers who now may not even see obstacles that litter the track. Don't believe me? Ask the drivers! Every driver that has driven with the halo has expressed their hatred for it. </p>

        <p>The next stupid thing about the halo is obviously how ugly it looks. Formula one is a glamorous sport, or it used to be before the big ugly halo. It is the main factor old die hard fans are 
        leaving the sport and ditching their merchandise. F1 has to lose the halo or it will lose all of its fans.</p>
